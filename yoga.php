            <p>Yoga is a holistic system of physical, mental, and spiritual practices that originated in ancient India. The word "yoga" is derived from the Sanskrit root "yuj," meaning to yoke or unite, reflecting its goal of integrating and harmonizing the body, mind, and soul. Yoga has evolved over thousands of years and encompasses a wide range of practices, but its primary aim is to achieve a state of balance and unity.</p>
            <p>Yoga is not just a physical exercise but a way of life that promotes self-awareness, mindfulness, and the development of a harmonious connection between the individual and the universe. It is practiced by millions of people worldwide for its physical, mental, and spiritual benefits. There are different styles and traditions of yoga, each with its emphasis on particular aspects of the practice, catering to a diverse range of preferences and goals.</p>
